My choice to use React was troublesome. I can't easily fit a build step into 
jekyll in a way that github pages would honor, so I need to run react with 
without babel.

There is [an in browser version of babel](https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone). It will be slow but fine for small one day projects like these. 
[now part of bable](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-standalone).

This [gist](https://gist.github.com/kentcdodds/5274dfa1eb31e6d22b9eddd1efc773dc) guided the way for how to get this working.
