How do I attach the logs to the experiment?

Need filter to only show day from date field. 

Settled on /#.md for experiment and /#/ for files.

It works, but This page looks awful. It's not getting formatted by anything. lets add a jekyll template to the front matter. 

Okay, now it looks awful because my site's layouts in general look awful. 

Hopefully it looks better by the time you are looking at it.

<img src="0/0.png" alt="" />

I'm going to consider the layout out

SUCCESS in about 3 Hours.
