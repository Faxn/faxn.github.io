Make a page:
    [] that presents things
    [] allows the user to reorder the things with drag and drop.
    [] remembers the order between refreshes. 

I'm going to try to work out a solution with just what I know before googling it. Only MDN and react docs for reference today. 

lets go with a css grid. 

turned out that ther presistence was much simpler than the draggin itself. 

This all took only about 3 hours.

    This example is doing a very similar thing. It's changing the parent instead of using grid properties though.
