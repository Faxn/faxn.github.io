Make a page:
    [] that presents things
    [] allows the user to reorder the things with drag and drop.
    [] remembers the order between refreshes. 

I'm going to try to work out a solution with just what I know before googling it. Only MDN and react docs for reference today. 

lets go with a css grid.

    This example is doing a very similar thing. It's changing the parent instead of using grid properties though.
